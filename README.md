## Introduction to CheatWatch (by Team Visionaries)
<p>
CheatWatch is an automated online proctoring solution that leverages artificial intelligence to provide remote invigilation and identity verification for ensuring the fairness and integrity of all online assessments. It will be used alongside Zoom meetings during online examinations.

CheatWatch comprises 2 main components for the respective stakeholders:
1. <b>CheatWatch Python Application Program for Students</b>

    Designed to track studentâ€™s examination behaviour, screen and system as well as environment.

2. <b>CheatWatch Web-Based Dashboard for Invigilators</b>

    Designed for invigilators to easily remotely monitor students during examinations, and get notified when there are suspicious activities observed.

Using technologies such as facial recognition, audio analysis and on-screen activity monitoring, CheatWatch incorporates the following features to effectively flag out suspicious cheating activities:
1. Student Authentication
2. Video Proctoring
3. Audio Proctoring
4. Screen Proctoring - Mouse and Keyboard Movement
5. Suspicious Activity Alert
6. Real-time Remote Invigilation

This provides real time information and alerts for the invigilator to take necessary actions or report to school authorities post-examination, helping invigilators to effectively invigilate large class sizes and identify cheating cases. This increases the fairness and integrity of online examinations, and reduces online cheating in examinations
